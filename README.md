# Grunt Source

> Reuse multiple Grunt environments across multiple projects

## Intro

**The Problem** - Grunt environments can quickly become quite complicated and whenever we need to reuse a Grunt environment, it requires us to copy the current project and remove the source leaving just the Grunt related files.

**A solution** - The Grunt team has made [grunt-init](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init) which gives you a *static* copy of a predefined template. Note, grunt-init does provides a way to template in new values for each copy however, this is can still be improved.

**A better solution** - Enter *Grunt Source*, instead of making numerous copies of a given Grunt environment, you can actually use one Grunt environment for multiple projects. Also, having a directory separation between the Grunt environment and the actual source will help to reduce the complexity of your project.

When using Grunt Source, projects will now contain only a `Gruntsource.json`, thereby abstracting the magic of Grunt outside of the project. This will help those who don't need to know the complexities of the build, yet still want to modify the source.

## Install

``` shell
npm install -g grunt-source
```

## Usage

Create a `Gruntsource.json` file in your project's root:

```
{
  "source": "~/.grunt-sources/ghpages",
  "repo": "https://github.com/jpillora/grunt-source-ghpages.git"
}
```

Then run:

```
grunt-source
```

*Just as you would normally use `grunt`, command line arguments and options work too!*

Then profit:

```
$$$
```

## Explaination

When you execute `grunt-source`, it will look for your `Gruntsource.json` file, then it will
look for the `source` directory, if it doesn't exist, `repo` will be cloned into
it, followed by an `npm install`. Finally, `grunt` will be executed **from the `source` directory**, while also
passing in a `--basedir` **option**. So all you need to add to your `Gruntfile.js` files is the line:
`grunt.file.setBase(grunt.option("basedir"));`. See this
[Gruntfile.coffee](https://github.com/jpillora/grunt-source-ghpages/blob/master/Gruntfile.coffee) for an example use case.

## Configuration

The `Gruntsource.json` file

* `source` - the directory where the *source* Grunt environment resides
* `repo` - the Git repository which

## CLI

The `grunt-source` executable will proxy all arguments to the `grunt` executable. So something like `grunt-source task2:target4 task3:target1` will work.

## Examples

See [grunt-source-ghpages](https://github.com/jpillora/grunt-source-ghpages) for another example grunt source

See [notifyjs-com](https://github.com/jpillora/notifyjs-com) for an example project using `grunt-source-ghpages`

<!--
See [grunt-source-jquery](https://github.com/jpillora/grunt-source-jquery) for an example grunt source

See [jquery-navigator](https://github.com/jpillora/jquery.navigator) for an example project using `grunt-source-jquery`
-->

## Todo

* Allow configuration from `Gruntsource.json` to augment the `grunt.initConfig(...)` configuration
